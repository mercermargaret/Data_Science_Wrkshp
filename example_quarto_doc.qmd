## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(knitr)
```


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-box
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_boxplot()
```

As you can see in @fig-box , males are larger than females!
